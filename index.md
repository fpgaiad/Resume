I'm an Android Developer who cares for excellence in good design and clean architecture code. Always aiming the highest level in development according to the current Google guidelines.

My history began in 2017 when I started to look for some way to build a mobile App to make some ideas come true. While, in parallel, I found my self seeking for some personal life project with a real meaning for me to pursuit. And it was the perfect match!

I started to spend all of my free time having fun with Java projects and some months later scratching the Android Studio also. Continuing, I dived deeply in coding, choosing Android and Kotlin as my study focus, and had a lot of help from the community and special people that unbelievably appeared in my way. It certainly was the best choice that I've made!

In July 2019 I was hired as the only Android developer on the engineering team at [Viva Decora](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=br.com.vivadecora.app), an architecture & decoration IT startup with more than 5 million monthly user accesses. There, I met extraordinary people who played a very important role in my career development. Thus, I was able contribute to the company and, at the same time, take a real improvement in my knowledge.

So, here I am, fulfilled and crafting my way through this amazing area.
