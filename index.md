# Welcome!

#### I'm an Android Developer who cares for excellence in good design and clean architecture code. Always aiming the highest level in development according to the current Google guidelines.

#### In 2017 I started to look for some way to build a mobile App to make some ideas happen. While in parallel, I found my self seeking for some personal life project that really has a meaning for me to pursuit, the one project that has the same frequency of mine. And it was the perfect match!

#### I started to spend all of my free time having fun with Java projects and some months later scratching the Android Studio also. Continuing, I dived deeply in coding and had a lot of help from the community and special people that unbelievably appeared in my way. It certainly was the best choice that I've made!

#### in July 2019 I was hired at Viva Decora (IT startup in the area of architecture and decoration with more than 5 million monthly sessions) as the only Android developer on the engineering team. There, I met exceptional people who played a very important role in the development of my career. In addition to contributing to the company, I improved on several fronts of knowledge in the area.

#### So, here I am. Crafting my way through this amazing area, fulfilled and convicted that I'm contributing to a better world.

#### Felipe Gaiad.
